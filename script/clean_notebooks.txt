Instructions to clean notebooks before pushing them in repository (if output is not needed, avoid conflict due to execution):


Usage should be for in-place operation:

jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace my_notebook.ipynb

Or to save to another file called my_notebook_no_out.ipynb:

jupyter nbconvert --clear-output \
  --to notebook --output=my_notebook_no_out my_notebook.ipynb
